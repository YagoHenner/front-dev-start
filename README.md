# Front-Dev-Start by Yago Henner

## Introduction

This project serves as a template for web software systems. It provides a starting point for building systems using **React**, **TypeScript**, **TailwindCSS**, and **Vite** as the main pillars.

## Technologies

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces;
- **TypeScript**: A strongly typed superset of JavaScript that adds static types;
- **TailwindCSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces;
- **Vite**: A build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects;
- Also comes with some Shadcn components built in. I like them.
